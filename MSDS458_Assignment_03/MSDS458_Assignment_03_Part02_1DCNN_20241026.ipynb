ComeToMyHead is an academic news search engine which has been running since July, 2004. The dataset is provided by the academic comunity for research purposes in data mining (clustering, classification, etc), information retrieval (ranking, search, etc), xml, data compression, data streaming, and any other non-commercial activity.<br>\n",

    "To implement a sequence model, you’d start by representing your input samples as sequences of integer indices (one integer standing for one word). Then, you’d map each integer to a vector to obtain vector sequences. Finally, you’d feed these sequences of vectors into a stack of layers that could cross-correlate features from adjacent vectors, such as a 1D convnet, a RNN, or a Transformer."
